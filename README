Have you ever missed the sleep function TVs and radio sets usually have in your android phone?

SleepPlayer for Android gives you that feature. When you tap on an audio download link you'll be asked to open it with SleepPlayer, which will let you set how long you want this audio stream to be played.

When the time is over the audio will fade out so you don't wake up by a suddenly interrupted playback.
